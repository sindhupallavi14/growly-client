# Growly Client

## 📖 Project Overview
Growly is a SaaS tool designed to help freelancers, coaches, small business owners, and ecommerce sellers create high-converting ad creatives quickly using AI.  
This repository contains the **React frontend** of Growly — a modern, responsive landing page with multiple sections and a lead capture form that integrates with the backend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Axios (for API requests)  
- Tailwind CSS (optional, if used)
